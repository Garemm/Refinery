    <H2>Distillation:</H2>
    <P>The crude oil is heated in a furnace and fed into a distillation column, which separates the different components based
    on their boiling points. Lighter components, such as gasoline and diesel, vaporize and rise to the top of the column,
    while heavier components, such as fuel oil and asphalt, remain at the bottom.</P>
